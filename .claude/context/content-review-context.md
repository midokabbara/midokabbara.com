### projects/analytics-redesign.html
1. **Problem section** - Change to:
   - "shopify's analytics was rigid. predefined reports, limited customization. merchants couldn't explore their own questions easily."
   - "the underlying assumption was that analytics is a linear process. in reality, merchants need both opinionated out-of-the-box templates and flexible exploration to drill down into performance, identify drivers, and answer questions as their analysis unfolds."
2. **Approach section** - Change to: "rather than just focusing on more templated reports and features, we rethought the analytics system to enhance explorability and serve as a consistent platform for improving product velocity - with central objects and consistent patterns, we could build faster and more consistently."
3. **What I built section** - Change to:
   - defined product vision: combine opinionated templates with flexible exploration
   - customizable reports and freeform exploration with a report experience that gives you the power of a BI tool without the overhead
   - configure data explorations through a UI config panel or by writing ShopifyQL
   - dashboards can now include any data exploration, not just curated metric cards
   - led cross-functional execution across design, engineering, data platform teams
4. **Outcome section** - Change to: "rollout started in 2024, shipped to all shopify merchants in 2025."

### projects/multi-store.html
1. **Problem section** - Change to:
   - "shopify plus merchants often have multiple stores: different regions, brands, currencies. before this project, there was no way to see unified performance across stores."
   - "this was a top-5 plus merchant pain point with no prior solution."
2. **Approach section** - Change to: "identified the gap through merchant calls and accumulated feedback. dove deeper to come up with the simplest approach to tackle the organization-level analytics experience."
3. **What I built section** - Change to:
   - unified dashboard, reports, and freeform data exploration that allow analysis of cross-store performance
   - ability to breakdown by any dimension: store, product, channel, etc.
   - shipped to plus organizations
4. **Outcome section** - Change to: "first comprehensive multi-store analytics in shopify's history. double-digit adoption within the first few weeks. shipped 2025."

### projects/the-drop.html

   - "the drop was amazon's first made-to-order fashion business. influencer-designed collections available for 30-hour windows, manufactured only after customers order."
   - "no system existed to manage demand signals to manufacturing."
2. **What I built section** - Change to:
   - designed and built amazon's first made-to-order demand management system: aggregating customer orders into purchase orders with factories, automatically closing purchases when fabric or manufacturing capacity was exhausted
   - developed the capacity planning approach for initial drops - determining fabric and manufacturing commitments before demand was known
   - created roadmap to reduce click-to-delivery time from three weeks to two weeks and manage excess capacity
3. **Outcome section** - Change to: "enabled the drop to launch globally in june 2019 without delays."

### projects/pod-subscription.html
1. **Problem section** - Change to: "identified an opportunity to combine amazon's print-on-demand business and existing licensing relationships with the subscription model. recurring customer purchase behavior and strong interest in branded themes suggested a large opportunity."

   - defined the business from scratch: business proposal, product requirements, customer experience, and financial model

   - team leveraged existing print-on-demand relationships to create various branded and themed subscription clubs
